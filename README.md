## Introduction

This project is the first one in Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree. The task was to train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- **`0`** - move forward
- **`1`** - move backward
- **`2`** - turn left
- **`3`** - turn right

The task is episodic. In order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of at least +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Agent

To solve the enviroment the Agent uses a Deep Q-Network with the following techniques:

1. **Experience Replay**: Storing and sampling experiences from a replay buffer to break correlation and enable efficient learning.
2. **Fixed Q-Targets**: Using a separate target network to provide stable targets during learning.
3. **Double DQN**: Decoupling the selection of the action from the evaluation to reduce overestimation bias.
4. **Dueling DQN**: Separating the estimation of state value and advantage for better policy evaluation.

## Possible Improvements

Implementing these techniques could potentially improve performance:

1. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Sampling more important transitions more frequently, which can improve learning efficiency.
2. **Learning from Multi-Step Bootstrap Targets**: Using n-step returns to provide more informative updates.
3. **Distributional DQN**: Learning a distribution over Q-values instead of just the expectation.
4. **Noisy DQN**: Incorporating noisy linear layers for exploration, which can lead to better performance in environments with high uncertainty.

## Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) 
	if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), 
	then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

### Instructions

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
